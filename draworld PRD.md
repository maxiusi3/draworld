## **1. Revision History**
| Version | Date | Author | Revision Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| V1.0 | 2023-10-27 | AIO-PM | Initial draft creation for MVP. |

## **2. Project Background & Goal**
### **2.1 Core Problem**
Parents of young children (ages 3-10) accumulate a large volume of physical artwork. These cherished creations are difficult to preserve, manage, and share effectively. They often end up stored in boxes, susceptible to damage and being forgotten. Furthermore, a static photograph fails to capture the imagination and story behind the child's art, missing an opportunity to further encourage their creativity.

### **2.2 Project Goals (MVP)**
1.  **Validate Core Value Proposition:** To verify that parents are willing to upload their children's drawings to an online service to transform them into animated videos. **Success Metric:** Achieve a 10% conversion rate from new visitor to first video generation.
2.  **Test Monetization Model:** To confirm user willingness to pay for premium features or additional usage through a credit-based system. **Success Metric:** Achieve a 1% paid conversion rate among active users.
3.  **Establish Initial Growth Loop:** To build and test a user referral system and a social sharing mechanism as primary drivers for early-stage user acquisition. **Success Metric:** Achieve a K-factor of > 0.1.

## **3. User Persona & Scenarios**
### **3.1 Target Persona**
*   **Name:** Sarah, the Millennial Mom
*   **Age:** 32
*   **Children:** A 6-year-old daughter (Lily) who loves drawing, and a 3-year-old son.
*   **Occupation:** Marketing Manager
*   **Behavior:** Tech-savvy, active on Instagram and Facebook, part of several parent groups online. Loves sharing her children's milestones.
*   **Frustrations:** Her refrigerator is covered in Lily's art. She takes photos of the best ones but they get lost in her phone's camera roll. She feels guilty when she has to throw some away to make space.

### **3.2 User Scenarios**
*   **Scenario 1: The Fresh Masterpiece:** Lily excitedly shows Sarah a new drawing of a "cat flying to the moon." Sarah immediately takes out her phone, goes to the Draworld website, snaps a photo of the drawing, types the prompt "A cat flying to the moon," and within a minute, shows Lily a short, magical animation of her cat astronaut soaring through space with a gentle background tune. Lily is ecstatic.
*   **Scenario 2: Rediscovering a Treasure:** While cleaning, Sarah finds a box of Lily's old drawings from when she was 4. She picks a favorite, a colorful zebra, and uses Draworld to create a video titled "Lily's First Zebra (Age 4)." She downloads the video and shares it to a private family group, adding a touching piece of digital memorabilia to their collection.

## **4. Feature Specifications**

### **4.1 Module 1: Core Creation Flow (Unregistered & Registered Users)**

#### **4.1.1 User Story 1.1: As a user, I want to upload a picture of an artwork so that I can use it as the base for my animation.**
*   **User Interface & Logic:**
    1.  On the creation page, a prominent upload area is displayed, accepting drag-and-drop on desktop.
    2.  Two buttons are present: `[ Select from device ]` and `[ Use Camera ]` (mobile only).
    3.  **Business Rules:**
        *   Accepted formats: JPEG, PNG.
        *   Max file size: 10MB.
        *   An error message will be shown for unsupported formats or sizes.
    4.  After selecting an image, it is displayed in an editing interface. A cropper tool is overlaid, allowing the user to drag and resize a box to select the main artwork area.
    5.  A `[ Confirm ]` button finalizes the crop and proceeds to the next step.

#### **4.1.2 User Story 1.2: As a user, I want to add a text prompt and select a mood so that I can guide the AI on how to animate my picture.**
*   **User Interface & Logic:**
    1.  A textarea is provided with placeholder text: "Describe the story in your art..."
    2.  Below the textarea, a section of "Prompt Ideas" displays clickable, pre-written templates (e.g., `A [character] is [action] in [place]`). Clicking a template populates the textarea, and the text remains fully editable.
    3.  A "Select Mood" section displays several iconic cards (e.g., `ðŸ˜Š Playful`, `ðŸ’– Heartwarming`, `ì›… Epic`). The user must select one. This selection determines the background music.
    4.  **Business Rules:**
        *   Prompt has a character limit of 300.
        *   Mood selection is mandatory.

#### **4.1.3 User Story 1.3: As a user, I want to generate and view the final video, so I can see my creation come to life and decide what to do with it.**
*   **User Interface & Logic:**
    1.  A final `[ âœ¨ Create My Video ]` button is displayed.
    2.  Next to it, the cost is shown: `(Costs 60 Credits)`. The user's current balance is also visible if logged in.
    3.  **Pre-generation States:**
        *   **Logged-in User (Sufficient Credits):** Clicking the button starts the generation process.
        *   **Logged-in User (Insufficient Credits):** The button is disabled or clicking it shows a modal: "Not enough credits. Please recharge or complete tasks to earn more." with `[ Buy Credits ]` and `[ Earn Credits ]` buttons.
        *   **Unregistered User:** Clicking the button will first direct them to a quick Sign Up/Log In modal. The sign-up bonus of 150 credits should be highlighted.
    4.  **Generation State (Waiting Page):**
        *   The user is taken to a waiting page.
        *   A progress bar and dynamic text ("Summoning magic...", "Painting the pixels...") are shown.
        *   A carousel of curated public creations is displayed to keep the user engaged.
    5.  **Post-generation State (Result Page):**
        *   The generated video is displayed in a large player with autoplay.
        *   Standard video controls (play/pause, volume, fullscreen) are available.
        *   Three main action buttons are displayed below the video: `[ Download ]`, `[ Share ]`, `[ Create Again ]`.

### **4.2 Module 2: User Account & Economy**

#### **4.2.1 User Story 2.1: As a new user, I want to quickly sign up or log in so I can save my work and manage my credits.**
*   **User Interface & Logic:**
    1.  A `[ Login / Sign Up ]` button is in the global header.
    2.  The primary login methods will be social: `[ Continue with Google ]`, `[ Continue with Apple ]`.
    3.  Upon first-time successful authentication, a user record is created in the database.
    4.  **Business Rules:**
        *   New users automatically receive a sign-up bonus of 150 credits. A welcome notification should confirm this.

#### **4.2.2 User Story 2.2: As a user, I want to earn credits through activities so that I can create more videos.**
*   **User Interface & Logic:**
    1.  **Daily Check-in:** In the "Credits" or user profile section, a `[ Check-in for today ]` button is available.
        *   **Business Rules:** Awards 15 credits. Button is disabled after clicking, with a timer showing when it's available again.
    2.  **Referral System:** An "Invite Friends" page provides a unique referral link.
        *   **Business Rules (The Viral Loop):**
            *   When a new user (Friend) signs up using the link, the Friend gets 50 bonus credits (on top of the standard 150). The referrer (You) gets 30 credits.
            *   When the Friend successfully generates their first video, the referrer (You) gets an additional 70 credits.
            *   Notifications must be sent to the referrer upon successful referral and conversion.
    3.  **UGC Social Task:** The "Invite Friends" page will also feature a task section.
        *   **UI:** "Share your video on Instagram/TikTok with the hashtag **#draworldapp**. Our team will review it and award you 100 credits!"
        *   **Backend:** Requires a simple admin interface for the team to view posts with the hashtag and manually award credits to a specific user ID.

#### **4.2.3 User Story 2.3: As a user, I want to purchase credits when I run out so I can continue creating.**
*   **User Interface & Logic:**
    1.  A "Buy Credits" page displays available packages in card format.
    2.  Packages (USD):
        *   $1.99 for 100 Credits
        *   $9.99 for 550 Credits (50 bonus)
        *   $49.99 for 2900 Credits (400 bonus)
        *   $99.99 for 6000 Credits (1000 bonus)
    3.  Selecting a package proceeds to a payment modal.
    4.  **Business Rules:**
        *   Payment processing will be handled by Stripe API.
        *   Upon successful payment confirmation from the Stripe webhook, the user's credit balance is updated in the database.
        *   An email receipt should be sent to the user.

### **4.3 Module 3: Content Management**

#### **4.3.1 User Story 3.1: As a logged-in user, I want to have a personal gallery to view all my past creations.**
*   **User Interface & Logic:**
    1.  A "My Gallery" link is available in the user dropdown menu.
    2.  Creations are displayed in a responsive grid layout. Each item is a card showing the video thumbnail, the prompt used, and creation date.
    3.  Hovering over a card reveals a play icon. Clicking it opens the video in a modal player.
    4.  Each card also has a "..." menu with `Share` and `Delete` options.
    5.  **Empty State:** If the user has no creations, a friendly illustration and a message ("Your gallery is empty. Let's create some magic!") with a `[ Start Creating ]` button is displayed.

## **5. Boundary Conditions & Constraints**
1.  **Third-Party Dependencies:** The core functionality relies on the Runware AI API. API latency, cost, and terms of service are critical constraints.
2.  **Platform:** This PRD is for a responsive web application, designed to be functional on both desktop and mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox latest versions).
3.  **Language:** All user-facing text must be in English.

## **6. Non-Functional Requirements**
*   **Performance:**
    *   Page load time should be under 3 seconds.
    *   Video generation time is dependent on the API, but the user must be kept informed on the waiting page. Target a maximum of 60 seconds for generation.
*   **Security:**
    *   Implement an automated pre-moderation check (e.g., using a content safety API) on all uploaded images to filter for inappropriate content.
    *   All user data must be handled securely and in compliance with GDPR/CCPA standards.
    *   Payment transactions must be securely processed via Stripe, with no sensitive card data stored on our servers.
*   **Usability:** The interface must be intuitive for non-technical parents. The core creation flow should require no more than 3-4 steps.

## **7. Data Metrics**
*   **Acquisition:** Track new user sign-ups by source (direct, referral, social media).
*   **Activation:** Funnel analysis for: `Visit -> Upload -> Set Prompt -> Click Generate`.
*   **Retention:** Daily Active Users (DAU), Next-day retention, Daily check-in rate.
*   **Revenue:** Total Revenue, Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), Purchase conversion rate.
*   **Referral:** K-factor, referral link clicks, successful referral sign-ups.

## **8. To Be Discussed / Future Considerations**
1.  **Copyright Policy:** The exact wording for the User Agreement regarding ownership of uploaded images vs. AI-generated videos needs legal review.
2.  **AI Model Specifics:** Which specific model version and parameters to use from the API for the best balance of quality and cost.
3.  **Watermarking:** Should MVP videos contain a subtle "Made with Draworld" watermark to aid branding and growth?
4.  **Child-Account Features:** The "Child Mode" (Direction B from our discussion) is a strong candidate for a future version to better protect creative freedom.
